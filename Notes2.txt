** How JVM handles Multi-threading ** 

-->Java's multi-threading capabilities are a part of java.lang package which makes it easy to implement simultaneous execution.

--> In a single core environment, Java's multi-threading is managed by the JVM and the OS Which switches in between the threads to give an illution of simultaneous execution.

--> In a multi-core environment, Java's multi-threading can take full advantage of the available cores because the JVM distribues the threads across multiple cores which allows a true parallel execution of the threads. 

--> Java supports multi-threading through java.lang.Thread class & java.lang.Runnable interface.

--> When a Java program starts, one thread begins running immediately which is known as main thread. This thread is responsible for executing the main method of a program
