--> In a multi-threaded environment threads often needed to communicate & co-ordinate with each other to complete a task.

--> If the commincation is not made properly then the threads keeps on waiting for their turn. As a result it leads to wastage of CPU resources & potential deadlock will occur.

--> There are some in-built methods such as 
(i) wait
(ii) notify 
(iii) notifyAll

--> These methods can only be called within a synchronized block or method.
