--> The LifeCycle of Thread in Java consists of several states, which a thread can move through during its execution.

LifeCycle of Thread:

(i) New: A Thread is created but not yet started

(ii) Runnable: After the start method is called, the thread becomes runnable. It is ready to run & is waiting for the CPU time.

(iii) Running: The thread is in this state when it is executing.

(iv) Blocked / Waiting: A thread is in this state when it is waiting for a resource or waiting for another thread to perform an action

(v) Terminated: A thread is in this state when it finishes its execution.



Q. To create a thread which method should we use ? By extending the Thread Class or Implementing the Runnable Interface ?

--> We can use any method to create a Thread. 

--> But when a class is already extending a Parent class then we have to implement the Runnable interface because multiple inheritance is not possible in Java.
