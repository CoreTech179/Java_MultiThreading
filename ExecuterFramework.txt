--> The Executors framework was introduced in Java 5 as a part of the java.util.concurrent package which is used to simplify the development of concurrent applications by abstracting away many of the complexities involved in creating & managing threads. 

--> In industry we will not create thread & run a thread manually we will defenitely use the executor framework. If we will create thread by ourself & run manually then there are many complexities will arise which is difficult to handle. 

--> Concurrent Application means: Applications that can do multiple things at the same time

There are 3 main core interfaces such as:

(i) Executor
(ii) ExecutorService
(iii) ScheduledExecutorService

Q. What is the difference between Runnable & Callable interface in java ?

--> Basically if we want to return something then we use Callable & when we don't want to return anything then we use Runnable.
